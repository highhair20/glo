ABOUT
========================================

Glo provides an automated way of creating a seamless webapp designed with MVC 
architecture in mind both on the server and the client. Glo is founded on the 
following principals:

    - The end user's experience is, above all, the most important aspect of a web app.
    - Technology limitations or hurdles should never limit or affect user's experience.
    - When possible, ease the developers' live by automating what makes sense and
      using intuitive defaults and conventions.
